# House-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project follows the CRISP-DM methodology to develop a robust house price prediction model.
It leverages a diverse set of machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques.
The repository includes implementations of various algorithms such as Linear Regression, Regularization, KNN, SVM, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, XG Boost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). 
These algorithms were applied to uncover relevant features and enhance accuracy in estimating effective house sale prices. Explore the repository to access the code and documentation for building and deploying the house price prediction model.
